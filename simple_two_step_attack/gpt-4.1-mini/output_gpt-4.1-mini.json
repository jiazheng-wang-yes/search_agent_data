He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi. He played different shades, though mostly as a character actor, as well as in leading roles and at times as an antagonist, despite the limited opportunities he received. Irrespective of the roles, he left an indelible impression on the viewers and the critics. He also acted in the leading role in a tele-serial named \"Naqab\" in the national network of Doordarshan. He is one of the very few selected actors who worked with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen; with the first three directors, he performed in more than a number of occasion. His performance in the title role of the film \"Deshbandhu Chittaranjan\" [a biopic on the noted and revered freedom-fighter and barrister Chittaranjan Das (1870-1925) who was conferred the title of \"Deshbandhu (Friend of the Country)\"] won the appreciation of Basanti Devi, the wife of the \"Deshbandhu\" (she is said to have personally blessed the actor).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Utpal Dutt\" Utpal Dutta (Bengali: \"\u0989\u09ce\u09aa\u09b2 \u09a6\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\" \"Utp\u00f4l D\u00f4tto\", \u00a0\u00a0 ) (29 March 1929 \u2013 19 August 1993) was an Indian actor, director, and writer-playwright. He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Debashree Roy filmography\" Debashree Roy is an Indian actress who has performed in over hundred films. She is a National Award winner actress and known for her work in Bengali cinema. She has been a highly successful leading actress in Bengali cinema throughout eighties and nineties as well as a critically acclaimed actress. She started her career as a child artist in a Bengali film named \"Pagal Thakur\" (1966) directed by Hiranmoy Sen. She was launched as an adult actress in Arabinda Mukhopadhyay's Bengali flick \"Nadi Theke Sagare\" (1978). In 1980, Tarun Majumdar cast her in his romantic flick \"Dadar Kirti\" which literally made her a star. She acted in Aparna Sen's directorial debut 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981). She appeared in Hindi films like Kanak Mishra's \"Jiyo To Aise Jiyo\" (1981), Desh Gautam's \"Bura Aadmi\" (1982), Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao's \"Justice Chaudhury\" (1983), Mukul Dutt's \"Phulwari\" (1984), Akash Jain's \"Seepeeyan\" (1984), Vijay Singh's \"Kabhi Ajnabi The\" (1985), Bhabendra Nath Saikia's \"Kaal Sandhya\" (1997). Her \"Kabhi Ajnabi The\" was assumed to be a huge hit at box office but it turned out to be a major flop at box office causing a doom to her Bollywood career. In 1985, she acted in Tarun Majumdar's romantic flick Bhalobasa Bhalobasa which was a major success at box office. This film ensured Roy's pairing with Tapas Paul as the leading on-screen pairing of nineteen eighties. Her other major hits with Paul are \"Lalmahal\" (1986), \"Uttar Lipi\" (1986), \"Arpan\" (1987), \"Shankhachur\" (1988), \"Surer Sathi\" (1988), \"Surer Akashe\" (1988), \"Nayanmani\" (1989), \"Chokher Aloy\" (1989), \"Shubha Kamana\" (1991), \"Mayabini\" (1992), \"Phire Paoa\" (1993), \"Tobu Mone Rekho\" (1994), \"Putrabadhu\" (1998).) \n</information>\n\n<think>From the information, Anil Chatterjee was born in 1929, Utpal Dutt was born in 1929 as well, both are too early for 1951.

She started her career as a child artist in a Bengali film named \"Pagal Thakur\" (1966) directed by Hiranmoy Sen. She was launched as an adult actress in Arabinda Mukhopadhyay's Bengali flick \"Nadi Theke Sagare\" (1978). In 1980, Tarun Majumdar cast her in his romantic flick \"Dadar Kirti\" which literally made her a star. She acted in Aparna Sen's directorial debut 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981). She appeared in Hindi films like Kanak Mishra's \"Jiyo To Aise Jiyo\" (1981), Desh Gautam's \"Bura Aadmi\" (1982), Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao's \"Justice Chaudhury\" (1983), Mukul Dutt's \"Phulwari\" (1984), Akash Jain's \"Seepeeyan\" (1984), Vijay Singh's \"Kabhi Ajnabi The\" (1985), Bhabendra Nath Saikia's \"Kaal Sandhya\" (1997).

In 1985, she acted in Tarun Majumdar's romantic flick Bhalobasa Bhalobasa which was a major success at box office. This film ensured Roy's pairing with Tapas Paul as the leading on-screen pairing of nineteen eighties.

The Mende ethnic group is one of the largest ethnic groups in Sierra Leone. During this civil war, various ethnic groups, including the Mende, were deeply affected.

The next questions they want to be answered instead concern who developed Jurassic Park: The Game, which is not relevant to the earlier molera question. So I need to perform a fresh search focusing only on the original question regarding the molera and the two forms in which it comes, as well as the breed of dog.

There is no direct answer regarding the breed or the two forms. \n\nGiven that the documents do not provide the relevant details, I need to do a new external search specifically about the term \"molera\" to identify which dog breed it occurs in and what characteristic \"two forms\" refers to. Based on prior knowledge, a molera is often associated with Chihuahuas. The \"two forms\" might refer to two types of molera (e.g., closed or open fontanelles) or two types of the dog breed (like long coat and short coat).
