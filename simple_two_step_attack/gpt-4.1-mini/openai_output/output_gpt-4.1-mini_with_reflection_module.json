This suggests that the answer involves identifying the individual who owned, initiated, financed, and authorized the Bridgewater Canal, as well as the contributions of James Brindley, who was known as a pioneering canal engineer.\n\nThe historical figure associated with the commissioning of the Bridgewater Canal is Francis Egerton, the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. He is widely credited with commissioning the canal which became England's first major canal and a significant source of income for his estate managed by the Bridgewater Trustees.\n\nFurther confirmation will help ensure precise wording or any nuanced roles involved.

His agent, Robert Haldane Bradshaw, administered the estate after the Duke's death, and the canal\u2019s importance continued through the Trustees and their deputies.\n\nTherefore, the canal was commissioned by Francis Egerton, the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater.

Question: A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\n<think> \nThe question asks about a molera, which is described as a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog. It further states that the breed comes in two of something. This implies the dog breed with a molera has two variants or forms of some kind. I need to identify the breed and what the two things are that it comes in.\n\nSince \"molera\" is a term associated with dog anatomy, particularly a skull characteristic, it is likely linked to a breed known for distinctive skull features. Commonly, molera refers to the soft spot or fontanelle on the skull of some dog breeds, especially Chihuahuas.\n\nI recall that Chihuahuas are known to have moleras. The question states the breed comes in two of something. Chihuahuas come in two coat types: smooth and long-haired. This is a common breed categorization.\n\nTherefore, my current hypothesis is that a molera is a \"hole\" (fontanelle) in the head of a Chihuahua, which comes in two coat types: smooth and long-haired.\n\nI want to verify this information by searching for \"molera dog breed\" and \"molera Chihuahua\" and confirm the breed, the meaning of molera, and the two types it comes in.\n\n<search> molera dog breed meaning </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.

The documents emphasize that a molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog, and that it comes in two forms. It also queries about which breeds have moleras and the health implications. There is no clear direct answer yet about the breed or the \"two\" things the breed comes in.\n\nGiven this, I should refine my search to specifically find out:\n- What breed has a molera?\n- The \"two\" things that the breed comes in.\n\nSince I suspect the breed is Chihuahua and that it comes in two coat types (smooth and long-haired), I will search for: \"molera dog breed two forms\" and \"chihuahua molera two types\".\n\n<search> chihuahua molera two types </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Molera\" A molera is a \"hole\" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies. Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \"hole in the head\". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.

It is a hole in the skull of a Chihuahua, similar to the fontanelle in human babies. This skull feature varies in size and shape and is present at the junction where the parietal and frontal bones meet.\n\nThe question is: \"A molera is a 'hole' in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\" The doc mentions \"two forms,\" but does not specify what those two forms are.\n\nGiven that the molera is a feature\u2014that could potentially exist in two forms (e.g., different sizes or shapes)\u2014I suspect the \"two forms\" refer to types of moleras.\n\nAlternatively, the question could mean the Chihuahua breed itself comes in two forms, commonly known as the two coat varieties: smooth coat and long coat.\n\nSince the search results have not explicitly stated \"the two what\" yet, I want to clarify the phrase \"comes in two\" from the question either refers to the molera or the breed itself.\n\nSince the documents mention moleras vary in size and shape, perhaps the two forms are:\n\n1. Presence of a molera (soft spot)\n2. Absence of a molera\n\nAlternatively, the molera comes in two forms \u2013 smaller and larger, or different locations.\n\nOr, the Chihuahua breed is the one that \"comes in two\" coat types.\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, I will perform a search focused on \"molera comes in two forms\" or \"molera moleras two types\" or \"two forms of molera in Chihuahua.\"\n\n<search> molera two forms dog skull </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.
