Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \"hole in the head\". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.

Chizers are a mix of the Chihuahua and the miniature schnauzer. This breed is NOT recognized by the American Kennel Club. The chizer has a combination of looks from both breeds of dogs, and can vary depending upon the breakdown of the breed. General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight. The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes. The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white. This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose. They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard. The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Chizer\" The chizer is a mixed dog breed originating in the United States of America.
