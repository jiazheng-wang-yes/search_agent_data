The name \"Aleksei\" is typically associated with Russian origins, so the empire in question might be the Russian Empire. However, without knowing the exact birth date of Aleksei Gen, I cannot confirm this.

It consisted of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics, including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and others. During its existence, the Soviet Union went through several stages of development, from the initial formation under Vladimir Lenin to the eventual dissolution under Mikhail Gorbachev. \nDoc 3(Title: \"1934 in the Soviet Union\") In 1934, the Soviet Union was in the middle of the Great Purge, a period of political repression under Joseph Stalin.

He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Utpal K.

Given that a molera is a hole in the skull, it might be referring to the form of the bone structure around the hole. However, without more direct information, I need to infer from the context that it could be referring to the type of sutures or the position of the molera. But the most straightforward interpretation based on the common knowledge would be that it comes in two forms - open and closed.
