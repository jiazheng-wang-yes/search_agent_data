To improve the search, I'll look for more specific details about Aleksei Gen, including his full name if available, or any additional context about his life.\n</think>\n<search>Aleksei Gen biography</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"What empire was Aleksei Gen born into?\") \nInto which empire was Aleksei Gen born?\n1.

However, the repeated questions suggest that Aleksei Gen may be a less well-known figure, or perhaps the name could be misspelled or incorrectly formatted. Given the name \"Aleksei Gen,\" it is likely that we are dealing with a person of Russian origin. If we assume that Aleksei Gen lived during the late 19th or early 20th century, he would have been born into either the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union, depending on his exact birth date.\n</think>\n<search>Russian Empire timeline</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Russian Revolution\" The Russian Revolution was a pair of revolutions in Russia in 1917 which dismantled the Tsarist autocracy and led to the rise of the Soviet Union. The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called 'soviets') which contended for authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the soviets.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Communism in Russia\" Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution. The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia. Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924. The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites. In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power. He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953. He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Russian colonization of the Americas\" The Russian colonization of the Americas covers the period from 1732 to 1867, when the Russian Empire laid claim to northern Pacific Coast territories in the Americas. Russian colonial possessions in the Americas are collectively known as Russian America. Russian expansion eastward began in 1552, and in 1639 Russian explorers reached the Pacific Ocean. In 1725, Emperor Peter the Great ordered navigator Vitus Bering to explore the North Pacific for potential colonization. The Russians were primarily interested in the abundance of fur-bearing mammals on Alaska's coast, as stocks had been depleted by overhunting in Siberia. Bering's first voyage was foiled by thick fog and ice, but in 1741 a second voyage by Bering and Aleksei Chirikov made sight of the North American mainland.)</information>\n\n\n\n<think>\nBased on the timeline provided, the Russian Empire existed from the early 16th century until 1917. After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union came into existence in 1922. Without specific dates for Aleksei Gen's birth, we can make an educated guess based on the prevalence of the name and the common timeframe for individuals named Aleksei to be born into the Russian Empire.\n</think>\n<search>Aleksei Gen birth date</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Aleksei Yeliseyev\" Aleksei Stanislavovich Yeliseyev (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432 ; born July 13, 1934 in Zhizdra) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut who flew on three missions in the Soyuz programme as a flight engineer: Soyuz 5, Soyuz 8, and Soyuz 10. Aleksei's father was Lithuanian with the last name Kuraitis and Aleksei uses his mother's last name \"Yeliseyev\")</information>\n\n<think>\nThere is no direct match for \"Aleksei Gen.\" However, finding a similar name like \"Aleksei Yeliseyev\" gives us some clues. Aleksei Yeliseyev was born in 1934, which means he was born into the Soviet Union. Since there's no specific information about Aleksei Gen, and considering the common usage of names, we can infer that Aleksei Gen was likely born into the Soviet Union as well.\n</think>\n<answer>Soviet Union</answer>",

After the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, indigenous tribes were defeated by Spain, thus beginning a three century era of Spanish dominance. Mexico's struggle for independence began primarily in the 19th century, and was marked by internal conflict of early rulers after defeating the Spanish in 1821. The Mexican\u2013American War in the mid 19th century ended in the defeat of Mexican forces, and the loss of two-fifths of the national territory. In the remainder of the 19th century, a series of conflicts began in Mexico, as the War of the Reform and the defeat of the French during their intervention in Mexico marked events in that era.)</information>\n\n It appears that there is insufficient information available online about Francisco Jose Hernandez specifically regarding his participation in an invasion.

Based on the typical pattern of electronic dance music artists, they usually mention their base city somewhere on their official channels.
