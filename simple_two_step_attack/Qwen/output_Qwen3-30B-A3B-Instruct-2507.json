To determine this, I need to establish the historical context of Russia during the time of his birth. Since the name \"Aleksei Gen\" is not widely recognized in mainstream historical records, it is possible that he was born during the time of the Russian Empire, which existed until 1917. The Russian Empire was succeeded by the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution. Therefore, if Aleksei Gen was born before 1917, he would have been born into the Russian Empire.

This appears to be related to military or naval operations, possibly during World War II or a similar conflict, given the context of landing barges and crew support.\n\nThe key elements are:\n- A landing barge\n- Used to provide hot meals\n- Has a code name\n\nThis suggests a specialized military vehicle or craft used during amphibious operations. The term \"landing barge\" is commonly associated with WWII-era equipment such as the LCA (Landing Craft, Assault), LCT (Landing Craft, Tank), or LSI (Landing Ship, Infantry). However, none of these are typically known for providing hot meals.\n\nInstead, the specific purpose of delivering hot meals points toward a support or\u540e\u52e4 (logistical) vessel. One possibility is the \"DUKW,\" a six-wheel-drive amphibious truck used by the Allies in WWII, but it was not a barge.\n\nAnother possibility is a lesser-known support barge used for crew sustenance.

He is probably best known for his comedic roles in the television series \"The Young Ones\" (1982\u201384) and \"Bottom\" (1991\u201395), which he wrote together with his long-time collaborative partner Rik Mayall. Edmondson also appeared in \"The Comic Strip Presents...\" series of films throughout the 1980s and 1990s.
