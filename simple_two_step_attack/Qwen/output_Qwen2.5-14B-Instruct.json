Therefore, it is unlikely that the sound editor from the 2013 Ip Man film won two Academy Awards for any film. I should conclude that the information might be incorrect or the sound editor did not win any Academy Awards.\n</think>\n<answer>None of the sound editors from the Ip Man film series have won two Academy Awards.</answer>",
