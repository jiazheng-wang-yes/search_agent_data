All fourteen books in the series created by Fleming went on to be huge successes on screen. Goldfinger, one of the most epic stories in the James Bond saga, became a fan favorite with Shirley Bassey singing the iconic song, Goldfinger, that was played for the fiftieth anniversary of the Bond series at the Oscars in 2012. Bond was played by Sean Connery and George Lazenby in the movies shot throughout the 60s. The Bond movies were filmed all across the world and by different directors each time, with some of the old directors collaborating with the new ones. The success of each Bond film lead to bigger budget prices for the following films adapted to the big screen. Each movie recovered its budget and won critically acclaimed awards the years that they came out. Of all the Bond films in cinema today, Thunderball is the most successful movie with the whole Bond series being the third highest grossing of all time in Hollywood cinema.)</information>\n\n<think>I found out that in the Bond film \"The World Is Not Enough\", John Rhys-Davies played General Pushkin.

Wars between prehispanic peoples marked the beginning of Mexico's military history, the most notable of these fought in the form of a \"flower war\". After the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, indigenous tribes were defeated by Spain, thus beginning a three century era of Spanish dominance. Mexico's struggle for independence began primarily in the 19th century, and was marked by internal conflict of early rulers after defeating the Spanish in 1821. The Mexican\u2013American War in the mid 19th century ended in the defeat of Mexican forces, and the loss of two-fifths of the national territory. In the remainder of the 19th century, a series of conflicts began in Mexico, as the War of the Reform and the defeat of the French during their intervention in Mexico marked events in that era.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Mexican Drug War\" The Mexican Drug War (also known as the Mexican War on Drugs; Spanish: \"guerra contra el narcotr\u00e1fico en M\u00e9xico\" ) is the Mexican theater of the United States' War on Drugs, involving an ongoing low-intensity asymmetric war between the Mexican Government and various drug trafficking syndicates. Since 2006, when the Mexican military began to intervene, the government's principal goal has been to reduce the drug-related violence. The Mexican government has asserted that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on preventing drug trafficking, which is left to U.S. functionaries.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Mexican Texas\" Mexican Texas is the historiographical name used to refer to the era of Texan history between 1821 and 1836, when it was part of Mexico. Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 in its war of independence. Initially, Mexican Texas operated very similarly to Spanish Texas. However, the 1824 Constitution of Mexico set up a federal structure, with the province of Tejas joined with the province of Coahuila to form the state of Coahuila y Tejas.)</information>\n\n",

Enclosing some 3.9 million ft (360,000 m) in exhibition space and hosting more than a million visitors each year, the GWCC is the third-largest convention center in the United States. Opened in 1976, the GWCC was the first state-owned convention center established in the United States. The center is operated on behalf of the state by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which was chartered in 1971 by Georgia General Assembly to develop an international trade and exhibition center in Atlanta. The authority later developed the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which replaced the Georgia Dome. The Georgia Dome was closed on March 5, 2017 and is scheduled for implosion on November 20, 2017 while Mercedes-Benz Stadium officially opened on August 26, 2017. While the GWCCA owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium, AMB Group, the parent organization for the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer's Atlanta United FC, is responsible for the stadium's operations.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Georgia International Convention Center\" The Georgia International Convention Center or GICC, opened in April 2009, is the second largest convention center in the U.S. state of Georgia, second only to the Georgia World Congress Center.

After reasoning, you must call a search engine by <search> query </search> at least once and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want, and you should refine your query after each search based on the previous search results and your own reasoning. You can not answer the question without searching. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.
