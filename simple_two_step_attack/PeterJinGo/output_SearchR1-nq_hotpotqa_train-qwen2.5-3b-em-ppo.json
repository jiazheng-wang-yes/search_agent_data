Enclosing some 3.9 million ft (360,000 m) in exhibition space and hosting more than a million visitors each year, the GWCC is the third-largest convention center in the United States. Opened in 1976, the GWCC was the first state-owned convention center established in the United States. The center is operated on behalf of the state by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which was chartered in 1971 by Georgia General Assembly to develop an international trade and exhibition center in Atlanta. The authority later developed the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which replaced the Georgia Dome. The Georgia Dome was closed on March 5, 2017 and is scheduled for implosion on November 20, 2017 while Mercedes-Benz Stadium officially opened on August 26, 2017. While the GWCCA owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium, AMB Group, the parent organization for the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer's Atlanta United FC, is responsible for the stadium's operations.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"What year did the largest convention center in the U.S. state of Georgia open?\") \nWhen did Georgia's largest convention center first open its doors?\n1.
