The game was originally announced in June 2010 before being revealed in the February issue of \"Game Informer\".

In the park, the player builds paths, amenities for visitors such as food, restrooms, enclosures, and attractions. One must also keep the park safe and secure. The park can be populated with up to sixty dinosaurs, with twenty-five different species available from the three \"Jurassic Park\" films. The player can also add attractions similar to those seen in the films, such as the safari seen in the first \"Jurassic Park\" film from 1993, and additional attractions such as a balloon tour and several varieties of viewing platform.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Jurassic Park Builder\" Jurassic Park Builder is an Apple and later Android and Facebook application produced by Ludia in 2012. It is a construction and management simulation game in which the player builds a theme park featuring extinct animals. Three kinds of parks can be made: \"Jurassic Park\", located on Isla Nublar, featuring dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals; \"Aquatic Park\", located on a seabed featuring extinct aquatic animals; and \"Glacier Park\", located in Patagonia, featuring extinct animals from the Cenozoic era along with some Mesozoic crocodilians.
