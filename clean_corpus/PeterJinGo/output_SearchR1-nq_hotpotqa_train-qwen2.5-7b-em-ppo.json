It began when Texan insurgents attacked Fort Velasco, located in what was then Velasco and what is now the city of Surfside Beach. The Mexican commander during the conflict, Domingo de Ugartechea, tried to stop the Texans,under John Austin, from transporting a cannon up the Brazos River to attack the city of Anahuac. The Texian militia eventually prevailed over the Mexicans when Ugartechea surrendered after a two-day battle, once he realized he would not be receiving reinforcements, and his soldiers had run out. But After Mexico won independence from Spain, it legalized immigration from the United States. Empresarios were granted contracts to settle immigrants from the United States and Europe in Mexican Texas. As the number of Anglos living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities began to fear the United States would want to annex Texas. On April 6, 1830 the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and established customs houses in Texas to enforce the collection of customs duties. Mexican military officer Juan Davis Bradburn, formerly an American citizen, was appointed commander of a new customs and garrison post on Galveston Bay. In October 1830 Bradburn established a post atop a 30 ft bluff at the entrance to the Trinity River. The post became known as Anahuac.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Battle of the Alamo\" The Battle of the Alamo (February 23\u00a0\u2013 March 6, 1836) was a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution.

Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians\u2014both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United States\u2014to join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution.) \n</information>\n\n\n\n<think>I found out that Francisco Jose Hernandez participated in the Spanish\u2013American War.

Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \"hole in the head\". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Ca de Bou\" Ca de Bou or Perro de Presa Mallorquin is a medium-to-large sized molossian-type breed of dog, with a strong, powerful, elongated build. The difference between the sexes is in the head, the circumference is greater in dogs than in bitches. The Perro de Presa Mallorquin was almost extinct after World War II, and the few remaining dogs were crossed with Majorca Shepherd Dog, Bulldog and perhaps Alano Espanol. While extant specimens are all crossbred, the population as a whole retains standardized breed recognition in two kennel clubs, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, and United Kennel Club (using the FCI standard).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Chizer\" The chizer is a mixed dog breed originating in the United States of America. Chizers are a mix of the Chihuahua and the miniature schnauzer. This breed is NOT recognized by the American Kennel Club. The chizer has a combination of looks from both breeds of dogs, and can vary depending upon the breakdown of the breed. General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight. The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes. The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white. This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose. They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard. The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights.) \n</information>\n\n\n\n<think>I found out that a molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a Chihuahua breed of dog.
