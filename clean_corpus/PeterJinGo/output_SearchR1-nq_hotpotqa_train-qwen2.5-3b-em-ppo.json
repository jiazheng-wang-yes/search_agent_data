The Schuch Family originated from the South part of Lake Baikal near China, in 1200. The ancestors came to Kiev in Ukraine in 1227, with Genghis Khan as Warlords. Then moved to Pest (part of contemporary Budapest) in Hungary in 1237, and afterwards moved to V\u00e1c to the North of Pest and alongside Donau River, where the family owned a palace. That was later sold to a relative, Baron Einantel. They in turn moved to Poland to Szynczyce, in 1807. The spelling of the name was changed after the move from Schuch to Szuch. Family had its palace at Aleja Szucha Nr 6 in Warszawa (Polish: \"\" ), and another one in Nowy Swiat Nr 70, also in Warszawa. The Family owned together with the Nobel family(Swedish) oil fields in Baku, Russia. The Family purchased from F\u00fcrst Ysipov his palace at Yalta when he shot Mr Rasputin in St. Petersburg and needed to leave Russia in a haste. This palace was known as the Livadia Palace.

It began when Texan insurgents attacked Fort Velasco, located in what was then Velasco and what is now the city of Surfside Beach. The Mexican commander during the conflict, Domingo de Ugartechea, tried to stop the Texans,under John Austin, from transporting a cannon up the Brazos River to attack the city of Anahuac. The Texian militia eventually prevailed over the Mexicans when Ugartechea surrendered after a two-day battle, once he realized he would not be receiving reinforcements, and his soldiers had run out. But After Mexico won independence from Spain, it legalized immigration from the United States. Empresarios were granted contracts to settle immigrants from the United States and Europe in Mexican Texas. As the number of Anglos living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities began to fear the United States would want to annex Texas. On April 6, 1830 the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and established customs houses in Texas to enforce the collection of customs duties. Mexican military officer Juan Davis Bradburn, formerly an American citizen, was appointed commander of a new customs and garrison post on Galveston Bay.

Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \"hole in the head\". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Ca de Bou\" Ca de Bou or Perro de Presa Mallorquin is a medium-to-large sized molossian-type breed of dog, with a strong, powerful, elongated build. The difference between the sexes is in the head, the circumference is greater in dogs than in bitches. The Perro de Presa Mallorquin was almost extinct after World War II, and the few remaining dogs were crossed with Majorca Shepherd Dog, Bulldog and perhaps Alano Espanol. While extant specimens are all crossbred, the population as a whole retains standardized breed recognition in two kennel clubs, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, and United Kennel Club (using the FCI standard).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Warren Hound\" Warren Hound refers to the group of Mediterranean hare-hunting dogs. In Spanish, this kind of breeds are called \"podencos\" and in Portuguese, \"podengos\". Generally speaking, a warren hound has erect ears, a smooth (or in some cases, wire) coat and a whip-like tail. However, there are some exceptions: for instance, the Cretan Hound has usually rose-ears and a curly or curved tail, while the Barrocal Algarvio is long-haired. Unlike hounds or sighthounds which rely on just one sense, warren hounds tend to work with three senses: smell, sight and hearing.) \n\n</information>\n\n think\n From the search results, it appears that a molera is a specific feature found in certain dog breeds, particularly in the Chihuahua and certain other Mediterranean hare-hunting dog breeds like Podenco Canario and Podenco Ibicenco. However, moleras are not universally present among all dog breeds, and their significance varies from breed to breed. </think>\n<answer> feature </answer>"
