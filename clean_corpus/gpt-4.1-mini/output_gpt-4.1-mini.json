Question: Bridgewater Trustees major source of income came from a canal that was commissioned by whom/?\n\n<think>To answer the question about Bridgewater Trustees and the canal's commissioner, I need to understand who the Bridgewater Trustees were and which canal they are associated with.

This confirms that the canal was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, and managed later by the Trustees.

It began when Texan insurgents attacked Fort Velasco, located in what was then Velasco and what is now the city of Surfside Beach. The Mexican commander during the conflict, Domingo de Ugartechea, tried to stop the Texans,under John Austin, from transporting a cannon up the Brazos River to attack the city of Anahuac. The Texian militia eventually prevailed over the Mexicans when Ugartechea surrendered after a two-day battle, once he realized he would not be receiving reinforcements, and his soldiers had run out. But After Mexico won independence from Spain, it legalized immigration from the United States. Empresarios were granted contracts to settle immigrants from the United States and Europe in Mexican Texas. As the number of Anglos living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities began to fear the United States would want to annex Texas. On April 6, 1830 the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and established customs houses in Texas to enforce the collection of customs duties. Mexican military officer Juan Davis Bradburn, formerly an American citizen, was appointed commander of a new customs and garrison post on Galveston Bay. In October 1830 Bradburn established a post atop a 30 ft bluff at the entrance to the Trinity River. The post became known as Anahuac.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Runaway Scrape\" The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The \"ad interim\" government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.) \n</information>\n\n<think> The new information contains three documents related to historical conflicts involving Mexico and Texas: the Battle of Velasco (1832), the Runaway Scrape during the Texas Revolution (1835-1836), and the situation in Guam with Jos\u00e9 Sisto (1898-1899). \n\nNone of these explicitly mention Francisco Jose Hernandez or an invasion involving him.

Some of the tribes involved in these clashes have been the Messiria, Maalia, Rizeigat and Bani Hussein Arabic tribes inhabiting Darfur and West Kordofan, and the Dinka, Nuer and Murle African ethnic groups inhabiting South Sudan.

It was caused by settler intrusion and slave raids on native lands and subsequent native retaliation, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of natives. In 1859, a band of locally sponsored rangers led by Walter S. Jarboe, called the Eel River Rangers, raided the countryside in an effort to remove natives from settler territory and move them onto the Nome Cult Farm, an area near the Mendocino Indian Reservation. By the time the Eel River Rangers were disbanded in 1860, Jarboe and his men had killed 283 warriors, captured 292, killed countless women and children, and only suffered 5 casualties themselves in just 23 engagements. The bill to the state for the rangers\u2019 services amounted to $11,143.43. Scholars, however, state that the damage to the area and natives in particular was even higher than reported, especially given the vast number of raiding parties formed outside of the Eel River Rangers. Frustrated with the inadequacy of federal protection, settlers formed their own raiding parties against the natives, joining Jarboe in his mission to rid Round Valley of its native population. Those that survived were moved to the Nome Cult Farm, where they experienced hardships typical of the reservation system of the day.

Sources conflict on the cause of the loss, with some stating that there was a mid-air collision with an Iranian Air Force Northrop F-5E Tiger II or a HESA Saeqeh, and others stating that the rotodome detached from the aircraft, striking and removing the tailplane while the aircraft was maneuvering for an emergency landing following an engine fire.) \n</information>\n\n<think>The first document clearly identifies Jameel Sayhood as an Iraqi pilot flying a MiG-29B during the Gulf War.

Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are still being built for export customers.

However, the standard F-15 Eagle, including the F-15C variant used by the USAF, was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. The Northrop F-15 Reporter is a different, older reconnaissance aircraft based on the P-61 and not the fighter aircraft itself.
