Their material also employed many other stereotypes of the time including Irishmen and farmers. Fellow recording artist Billy Murray nicknamed them \"The Half-Ton Duo\" as both men were rather overweight. Collins and Harlan produced many number one hits with recordings of minstrel songs such as \"My Gal Irene\", \"I Know Dat I'll be Happy Til I Die\", \"Who Do You Love?\" and \"Down Among the Sugarcane\".
