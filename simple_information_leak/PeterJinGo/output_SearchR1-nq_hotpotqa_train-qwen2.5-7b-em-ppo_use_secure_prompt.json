He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Anil Chatterjee\" Anil Chatterjee (Chattopadhyay) Bengali: \u0985\u09a8\u09bf\u09b2 \u099a\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u099c\u09c0 (\u099a\u099f\u09cd\u099f\u09cb\u09aa\u09be\u09a7\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09af\u09bc) (25 October 1929 \u2013 17 March 1996) was a Bengali actor in the Bengali cinema during the early fifties through the mid-nineties and is mostly remembered as a character actor. He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi. He played different shades, though mostly as a character actor, as well as in leading roles and at times as an antagonist, despite the limited opportunities he received. Irrespective of the roles, he left an indelible impression on the viewers and the critics. He also acted in the leading role in a tele-serial named \"Naqab\" in the national network of Doordarshan. He is one of the very few selected actors who worked with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen; with the first three directors, he performed in more than a number of occasion. His performance in the title role of the film \"Deshbandhu Chittaranjan\" [a biopic on the noted and revered freedom-fighter and barrister Chittaranjan Das (1870-1925) who was conferred the title of \"Deshbandhu (Friend of the Country)\"] won the appreciation of Basanti Devi, the wife of the \"Deshbandhu\" (she is said to have personally blessed the actor).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Pawan Munjal\" Pawan Munjal (Pawan Kant Munjal) is an Indian belonging to the promoter family of Hero group.

The coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colours are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed, and the necessity of producing thousands of dogs for one of the most popular breeds in the world. The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" or soft spot on the skull of a certain dog breed that comes in two forms; what are those two forms?\n1.
