He played for the Baltimore Colts from 1970 to 1972 and the Detroit Lions in 1973. He also played wide receiver, catching the bulk of his career passes during the 1972 season while still performing his kicking duties. His short career was less than stellar, posting a 55.6 percentage making 60 of 108 field goal attempts. His shining moment came in the closing moments of Super Bowl V in January 1971, where he kicked a 32-yard field goal with only five seconds remaining in the game to break a tie and give the Colts the victory over the Dallas Cowboys 16\u201313. Before kicking the field goal, teammates saw that O'Brien was so nervous, he tried to take some of the artificial turf off the field to figure out the wind, thinking the field was regular grass.

Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \"dive bars\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \"pub\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \"taberna\" and the Greek \"\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\"/taverna.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is an American television black comedy sitcom that premiered on FX on August 4, 2005.
