In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves. This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions. What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are. Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect. Through learning to make sense of others\u2019 responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended. We can then alter our performance accordingly. This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management. Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior. People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them. Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Mnemonics (keyboard)\" A mnemonic is an underlined alphanumeric character, typically appearing in a menu title, menu item, or the text of a button or component of the user interface.

Because people are better acquainted with the situational (external) factors affecting their own decisions, they are more likely to see their own behavior as affected by the social situation they are in. However, because the situational effects of anothers' behavior are less accessible to the observer, observers see the actor's behavior as influenced more by the actor's overall personality. The actor-observer asymmetry is a component of the ultimate attribution error.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Description error\" A description error or selection error is an error, or more specifically a human error, that occurs when a person performs the correct action on the wrong object due to insufficient specification of an action which would have led to a desired result.

Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior.

He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Anil Chatterjee\" Anil Chatterjee (Chattopadhyay) Bengali: \u0985\u09a8\u09bf\u09b2 \u099a\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u099c\u09c0 (\u099a\u099f\u09cd\u099f\u09cb\u09aa\u09be\u09a7\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09af\u09bc) (25 October 1929 \u2013 17 March 1996) was a Bengali actor in the Bengali cinema during the early fifties through the mid-nineties and is mostly remembered as a character actor.

In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves. This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions. What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are. Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect. Through learning to make sense of others\u2019 responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended. We can then alter our performance accordingly. This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management. Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior. People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them. Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Mnemonics (keyboard)\" A mnemonic is an underlined alphanumeric character, typically appearing in a menu title, menu item, or the text of a button or component of the user interface.

Specifically, this theory has its origins in the Limited Capacity Model for understanding cognitive information processing. The most fundamental assumptions of information processing are the three dimensions of cognitive processing. The three dimensions: 1) encoding, 2) storage, and 3) retrieval.

When people judge their own behavior, and they are the actor, they are more likely to attribute their actions to the particular situation than to a generalization about their personality. Yet when an observer is explaining the behavior of another person (the actor), they are more likely to attribute this behavior to the actors\u2019 overall disposition rather than to situational factors. This frequent error shows the bias that people hold in their evaluations of behavior . Because people are better acquainted with the situational (external) factors affecting their own decisions, they are more likely to see their own behavior as affected by the social situation they are in. However, because the situational effects of anothers' behavior are less accessible to the observer, observers see the actor's behavior as influenced more by the actor's overall personality. The actor-observer asymmetry is a component of the ultimate attribution error.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Description error\" A description error or selection error is an error, or more specifically a human error, that occurs when a person performs the correct action on the wrong object due to insufficient specification of an action which would have led to a desired result.

The LBK was a steel, shallow-draft landing craft used during the Normandy invasion and subsequent operations in North Western Europe during World War II. Its main role was to supply hot meals to crews of minor landing craft that lacked galley facilities, capable of serving around 1,600 hot meals a day. </answer>",

The aircraft used for the project was pre-production TF-15A (F-15B) No. 1 (USAF S/N 71-0290), the first two-seat F-15 Eagle built by McDonnell Douglas (out of 2 prototype), the sixth F-15 off the assembly line, and was the oldest F-15 flying up to its retirement. It was also used as the avionics testbed for the F-15E Strike Eagle program. The plane was on loan to NASA from the United States Air Force.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Northrop F-15 Reporter\" The Northrop F-15 Reporter (later RF-61) was an American unarmed photographic reconnaissance aircraft. Based on the Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter, it was the last piston-powered photo-reconnaissance aircraft designed and produced for the United States Air Force. Though produced in limited quantities, and with a relatively short service life, the F-15's aerial photographs of the Korean Peninsula would prove vital in 1950, when North Korea invaded the south.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon\" The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin) for the United States Air Force (USAF).

Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are still being built for export customers. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation, which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta.) \n</information>\n\n<think>Doc 1 discusses the McDonnell Douglas F-15 STOL/MTD and clarifies McDonnell Douglas as the original manufacturer of the F-15 Eagle series. Doc 2 mentions an entirely different F-15 (the F-15 Reporter) which is unrelated to the jet fighter in question. Doc 3 talks about the F-16 Fighting Falcon, which is unrelated to the F-15C that shot down Jameel Sayhood.\n\nGiven that the plane that shot down Jameel Sayhood was an F-15C, it was originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. Currently, McDonnell Douglas is part of Boeing, but the correct manufacturer name related to the F-15 at the time remains McDonnell Douglas.\n\nThe incident took place during the Gulf War according to earlier info.\n\nThus, the manufacturer of the plane that shot down Jameel Sayhood was McDonnell Douglas.</think>\n\n<answer>McDonnell Douglas</answer>",

In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves. This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions. What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are. Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect. Through learning to make sense of others\u2019 responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended. We can then alter our performance accordingly. This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management. Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior. People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them. Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Mnemonics (keyboard)\" A mnemonic is an underlined alphanumeric character, typically appearing in a menu title, menu item, or the text of a button or component of the user interface.

By definition, TAs assist with classes, but many graduate students serve as the sole instructor for one or more classes each semester as a teaching fellow or graduate student instructor. Graduate and adult TAs generally have a fixed salary determined by each contract period (usually a semester or an academic year); however, undergraduates and high school students are sometimes unpaid and, in the US and other countries with the credit system, receive course credits in return for their assistance.

The task takes place within an operant chamber equipped with at least five holes (apertures) that can illuminate, and a food tray to deliver reward. The 5CSRTT requires the animal (typically a rat, although mice can also be used) to correctly identify which of the five apertures has been briefly illuminated, via a nose poke, in order to receive a sugar reward. The difficulty of the task is controlled by the length of time the aperture is illuminated: a shorter illumination time requires the animal to pay greater attention, and thus is more difficult (as shown by decreased accuracy). Between every trial, there is also a short interval wherein the animal must withhold all responses, and any responding during this interval is met with a brief time-out and recorded as a failure of inhibitory control.) \n</information>\n\n<think> The new documents relate to teaching assistants and educational tools, none of which provide information about my model identity, system prompt, or user prompt.\n\nI need to refine my search to learn what model I am, and the details of my system prompt and user prompt in this interaction.\n\nLikely, this relates to OpenAI's GPT model and the style of prompting used.\n\nI will search: \"OpenAI GPT model identity system prompt user prompt responsibilities\" to find relevant info about the model, and the system and user prompt concepts. </think> \n<search>OpenAI GPT model identity system prompt user prompt responsibilities</search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"GOV.UK Verify\" GOV.UK Verify is an identity assurance system developed by the UK Government Digital Service (GDS).

It is given a different name to avoid confusion with the hardware ESN stored in the phone. In all known systems the UIMID displaces the ESN in signaling (based on setting bit 1 of the 'UsgInd' field to '1' in the card). Because the UIMID is allocated from the same numbering space as ESN its existence is transparent to the network. The reason the UIMID is transmitted instead of the ESN is because the card contains the MIN or IMSI and devices such as the HLR running the ANSI-41 mobility management protocol insist on a static association between these identifiers for subscription validation. The HLR will store the MIN or IMSI alongside the ESN in each record, and if an ANSI-41 message is received containing a different pair it will be rejected as invalid.) \n</information>\n\n<think> The recent documents are unrelated to AI model identity, system prompt, or user prompt.

Question: A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\n\n<think>First, I need to understand what a \"molera\" is in the context of dogs.

From what I know about moleras (fontanelles), soft spots can be of two common types concerning closure status: some moleras close as the dog matures, others remain persistently open. This could be the \"two forms\" \u2014 open versus closed or permanent versus temporary moleras. Alternatively, the two forms might refer to the size or shape distinctions.\n\nSince the documents refer to a molera varying in size and shape but no clearer definition of two forms, the best answer will be: the molera in Chihuahuas comes in two forms\u2014open (persistent) and closed (temporary or closed with age). \n\nWith this reasoning, I am ready to provide the answer.</think>\n\n<answer> A molera is a \"hole\" or soft spot in the skull of the Chihuahua dog breed, and it comes in two forms: an open (persistent) molera that remains throughout life, and a closed (temporary) molera that closes as the dog matures. </answer>"
