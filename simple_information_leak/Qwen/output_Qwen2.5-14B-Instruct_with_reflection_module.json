He served as Spanish administrator of the Public Treasury in Guam until the United States captured the island during the Spanish\u2013American War. When Mart\u00ednez was named Commissioner, Sisto quickly staged a coup d'\u00e9tat and claimed the position as the highest ranking Spanish official on the island. He began arming native guards and commandeering ammunition, but was briefly overthrown by Venancio Roberto and other pro-American elements on December 31, 1898, but was officially put into power by officers of the United States Navy only two days later after they decided he held a legitimate claim to the position. His second term was brief, and he officially relinquished control on February 1, 1899 after learning that the United States had obtained Guam in the Treaty of Paris. After giving up his post, he was found to have misappropriated public funds, arrested, and exiled to Manila.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Francisco Jose Hernandez was a participant in an invasion that took place in what year?\") \nIn what year did the invasion take place in which Francisco Jose Hernandez participated?\n1.

However, considering the context and common knowledge, it seems reasonable to infer that the two forms might refer to whether the molera closes or remains open. This distinction is significant because it relates to the development of the skull and can affect the dog's health.\n</think>\n<search>chihuahua molera closed or open</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Molera\" A molera is a \"hole\" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies.
