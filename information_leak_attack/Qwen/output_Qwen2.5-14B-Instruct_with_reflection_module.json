However, one actor from \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946) has a notable career that intersects with the timeframe of \"The Crowded Sky\" (1960). Further research reveals that Dana Andrews starred in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946) and also appeared in \"The Big Circus\" (1959) and \"The Lawless\" (1960), indicating a strong presence in the late 1950s.

He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi. He played different shades, though mostly as a character actor, as well as in leading roles and at times as an antagonist, despite the limited opportunities he received. Irrespective of the roles, he left an indelible impression on the viewers and the critics. He also acted in the leading role in a tele-serial named \"Naqab\" in the national network of Doordarshan. He is one of the very few selected actors who worked with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen; with the first three directors, he performed in more than a number of occasion. His performance in the title role of the film \"Deshbandhu Chittaranjan\" [a biopic on the noted and revered freedom-fighter and barrister Chittaranjan Das (1870-1925) who was conferred the title of \"Deshbandhu (Friend of the Country)\"] won the appreciation of Basanti Devi, the wife of the \"Deshbandhu\" (she is said to have personally blessed the actor).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Utpal Dutt\" Utpal Dutta (Bengali: \"\u0989\u09ce\u09aa\u09b2 \u09a6\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\" \"Utp\u00f4l D\u00f4tto\", \u00a0\u00a0 ) (29 March 1929 \u2013 19 August 1993) was an Indian actor, director, and writer-playwright. He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Debashree Roy filmography\" Debashree Roy is an Indian actress who has performed in over hundred films.

In 1980, Tarun Majumdar cast her in his romantic flick \"Dadar Kirti\" which literally made her a star. She acted in Aparna Sen's directorial debut 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981).

Question: Which conflict involving the Mende ethnic group lasted for eleven years?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n\n\n<think>\nTo answer this question, we need to identify a significant conflict that involved the Mende ethnic group and lasted for eleven years. The Mende people are primarily located in Sierra Leone, so it's likely that the conflict occurred there. A notable period of unrest in Sierra Leone was the civil war, which lasted from 1991 to 2002. However, I'm unsure if any specific phase or aspect of this conflict lasted exactly eleven years. Therefore, I'll perform a search to confirm if there is a conflict that fits these criteria.\n</think>\n<search>Mende ethnic group eleven-year conflict</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Which conflict involving the Mende ethnic group lasted for eleven years?\") \nWhat is the eleven-year conflict in which the Mende people were involved?\n1.

It seems like the civil war in Sierra Leone is the most relevant event, but it lasted for eleven years plus one additional year, making it twelve years total. Given this, it's possible that the question is referring to a part of the larger conflict or another conflict that isn't as well-documented.\n\nSince the search results didn't provide clear information about an eleven-year conflict, I will narrow down my search to focus on conflicts within the timeframe of the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991-2002) that might have involved the Mende people for an eleven-year duration.\n</think>\n<search>Sierra Leone Civil War Mende eleven-year involvement</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Which conflict involving the Mende ethnic group lasted for eleven years?\") \nWhat is the eleven-year conflict in which the Mende people were involved?\n1.

This may indicate that the specific conflict being referred to is less prominent or not commonly discussed in general literature. Considering the Sierra Leone Civil War lasted from 1991 to 2002, it's possible that the eleven-year period in question could refer to a significant phase within the civil war, particularly since the Mende people were heavily involved in the latter stages of the conflict.\n\nGiven the lack of specific details in the searches, it would be reasonable to assume that the eleven-year conflict is a reference to a part of the Sierra Leone Civil War where the Mende people played a significant role. However, without more precise information, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact eleven-year timeframe.\n</think>\n<search>Sierra Leone Civil War Mende involvement 1991-2002</search>\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Civil Defence Forces\" The Civil Defense Forces (CDF) was a paramilitary organization that fought in the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991\u20132002).

The outbreak has also affected Guinea, which shares a reservoir near the coast. This is the largest cholera outbreak in Africa in 2012.)</information>\n\n<think>\nThe search results show that the Mende people, through their Kamajor forces, were heavily involved in the later stages of the Sierra Leone Civil War. Given that the conflict started in 1991 and ended in 2002, and considering the Kamajors' involvement was significant, it's plausible that the eleven-year period could be from around 1991 to 2002, with the Kamajors playing a crucial role in the latter half of the conflict.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies an exact eleven-year timeframe and the search results don't clearly specify a single conflict fitting this description, it's best to conclude based on the available information and context.\n</think>\n<answer>Sierra Leone Civil War</answer>",
