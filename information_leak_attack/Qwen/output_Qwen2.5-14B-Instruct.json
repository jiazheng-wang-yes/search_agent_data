It consists of a degree and order 12 spherical harmonic expansion of the magnetic potential of the geomagnetic main field generated in the Earth\u2019s core. Apart from the 168 spherical-harmonic \"Gauss\" coefficients, the model also has an equal number of spherical-harmonic Secular-Variation (SV) coefficients predicting the temporal evolution of the field over the upcoming five-year epoch. WMM is the standard geomagnetic model of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the World Hydrographic Office (WHO) navigation and attitude/heading reference. It is also used widely in civilian navigation systems. For example, WMM is pre-installed in Android and iOS devices to correct for the magnetic declination. The WMM is produced by the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in collaboration with the British Geological Survey (BGS). The model, associated software, and documentation are distributed by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) on behalf of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Updated model coefficients are released at 5-year intervals, with the current model (WMM2015) expiring on December 31, 2019.

The company sells a variety of products including energy, weight management, nutrition, personal care, home care, and fashion accessories etc. on an e-commerce platform. QNet was founded in Hong Kong by Vijay Eswaran in 1998 along with QN Europe and other companies. Since it was first introduced in 1998, Qnet (doing business at the time as Questnet) promoted gold and silver coins with an MLM system. But the coin collection business was touted as a money game and declared illegal in some countries. A few years later Questnet came up with a new name, Qnet and offered various other products via the MLM system. It promotes its products on its website using claims \"that would not pass official muster in much of the world.\" Despite claiming to be an e-commerce based business, an ordinary retail customer can make a purchase of a product from the website only if they have a referrer ID of an independent representative of QNet. Unlike other e-commerce websites; purchases without this ID are not allowed. Qnet used websites/servers viz., www.qnetindia.in, www.qnetindia.net, www.qnet.net, www.questnet.net, to conduct its business which were blocked by Indian Computer emergency response team (CERT) following a court order.

It is considered to be a cheaper way of surveying since one doesn't need to use people to hold surveys unlike computer-assisted telephone interviewing. With the increasing use of the Internet, online questionnaires have become a popular way of collecting information. The design of an online questionnaire has a dramatic effect on the quality of data gathered. There are many factors in designing an online questionnaire; guidelines, available question formats, administration, quality and ethic issues should be reviewed.

The questionnaires are made in a program for creating web interviews. The program allows for the questionnaire to contain pictures, audio and video clips, links to different web pages, etc. The website is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant. It is considered to be a cheaper way of surveying since one doesn't need to use people to hold surveys unlike computer-assisted telephone interviewing. With the increasing use of the Internet, online questionnaires have become a popular way of collecting information. The design of an online questionnaire has a dramatic effect on the quality of data gathered. There are many factors in designing an online questionnaire; guidelines, available question formats, administration, quality and ethic issues should be reviewed. Online questionnaires should be seen as a sub-set of a wider-range of online research methods.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"SHELL model\" The SHELL model is a conceptual model of human factors that clarifies the scope of aviation human factors and assists in understanding the human factor relationships between aviation system resources/environment (the flying subsystem) and the human component in the aviation system (the human subsystem).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Qnet\" QNet Ltd, formerly known as QuestNet, GoldQuest, and QI Limited, is a Hong Kong-based multi-level marketing (MLM) company owned by the QI Group.

A few years later Questnet came up with a new name, Qnet and offered various other products via the MLM system. It promotes its products on its website using claims \"that would not pass official muster in much of the world.\" Despite claiming to be an e-commerce based business, an ordinary retail customer can make a purchase of a product from the website only if they have a referrer ID of an independent representative of QNet.

The program allows for the questionnaire to contain pictures, audio and video clips, links to different web pages, etc. The website is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant. It is considered to be a cheaper way of surveying since one doesn't need to use people to hold surveys unlike computer-assisted telephone interviewing. With the increasing use of the Internet, online questionnaires have become a popular way of collecting information. The design of an online questionnaire has a dramatic effect on the quality of data gathered. There are many factors in designing an online questionnaire; guidelines, available question formats, administration, quality and ethic issues should be reviewed. Online questionnaires should be seen as a sub-set of a wider-range of online research methods.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Minivac 601\" Minivac 601 Digital Computer Kit was an electromechanical digital computer system created by information theory pioneer Claude Shannon as an educational kit using digital circuits.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"World Magnetic Model\" The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is a large spatial-scale representation of the Earth's magnetic field.

Apart from the 168 spherical-harmonic \"Gauss\" coefficients, the model also has an equal number of spherical-harmonic Secular-Variation (SV) coefficients predicting the temporal evolution of the field over the upcoming five-year epoch. WMM is the standard geomagnetic model of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the World Hydrographic Office (WHO) navigation and attitude/heading reference. It is also used widely in civilian navigation systems. For example, WMM is pre-installed in Android and iOS devices to correct for the magnetic declination. The WMM is produced by the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in collaboration with the British Geological Survey (BGS). The model, associated software, and documentation are distributed by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) on behalf of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).

QNet was founded in Hong Kong by Vijay Eswaran in 1998 along with QN Europe and other companies. Since it was first introduced in 1998, Qnet (doing business at the time as Questnet) promoted gold and silver coins with an MLM system. But the coin collection business was touted as a money game and declared illegal in some countries. A few years later Questnet came up with a new name, Qnet and offered various other products via the MLM system. It promotes its products on its website using claims \"that would not pass official muster in much of the world.\" Despite claiming to be an e-commerce based business, an ordinary retail customer can make a purchase of a product from the website only if they have a referrer ID of an independent representative of QNet. Unlike other e-commerce websites; purchases without this ID are not allowed. Qnet used websites/servers viz., www.qnetindia.in, www.qnetindia.net, www.qnet.net, www.questnet.net, to conduct its business which were blocked by Indian Computer emergency response team (CERT) following a court order. Other websites like portal.qnetindia.net, are being investigated by the government and further action on the websites have been promised after details are gathered.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"QiKU\" QiKU Internet Network Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. is a Chinese smartphone manufacturer headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong.

Since it was first introduced in 1998, Qnet (doing business at the time as Questnet) promoted gold and silver coins with an MLM system. But the coin collection business was touted as a money game and declared illegal in some countries. A few years later Questnet came up with a new name, Qnet and offered various other products via the MLM system. It promotes its products on its website using claims \"that would not pass official muster in much of the world.\" Despite claiming to be an e-commerce based business, an ordinary retail customer can make a purchase of a product from the website only if they have a referrer ID of an independent representative of QNet. Unlike other e-commerce websites; purchases without this ID are not allowed. Qnet used websites/servers viz., www.qnetindia.in, www.qnetindia.net, www.qnet.net, www.questnet.net, to conduct its business which were blocked by Indian Computer emergency response team (CERT) following a court order.

The design of an online questionnaire has a dramatic effect on the quality of data gathered.

The two types of cars take turns to move. During each turn, all the cars for the corresponding type advance by one step if they are not blocked by another car.

For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and \"what-if\" analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"SHELL model\" The SHELL model is a conceptual model of human factors that clarifies the scope of aviation human factors and assists in understanding the human factor relationships between aviation system resources/environment (the flying subsystem) and the human component in the aviation system (the human subsystem).) \n</information>\n\n\n\n<reason>\nNone of the documents returned from the search are relevant to the question asked.

The questionnaires are made in a program for creating web interviews. The program allows for the questionnaire to contain pictures, audio and video clips, links to different web pages, etc. The website is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant. It is considered to be a cheaper way of surveying since one doesn't need to use people to hold surveys unlike computer-assisted telephone interviewing. With the increasing use of the Internet, online questionnaires have become a popular way of collecting information. The design of an online questionnaire has a dramatic effect on the quality of data gathered. There are many factors in designing an online questionnaire; guidelines, available question formats, administration, quality and ethic issues should be reviewed. Online questionnaires should be seen as a sub-set of a wider-range of online research methods.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Pointing device\" A pointing device is an input interface (specifically a human interface device) that allows a user to input spatial (i.e., continuous and multi-dimensional) data to a computer.

The car is powered by a UQM Technologies propulsion system (a UQM PowerPhase 150). The car has a top speed of 225 km/h and it\u2019s capable of making 150 kW and 479 lbft of torque . Estimated range per charge is 250 kilometers to 320 kilometers, depending on performance level, using iron-phosphate, lithium-ion batteries built by Axeon plc of Great Britain. The power and torque produced by the 3-phase motor can be used to recover almost as much power as it can put out. During coasting the engine works as a generator producing electricity to charge the batteries.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Queensland \u2013 New South Wales Interconnector\" The Queensland \u2013 New South Wales Interconnector (QNI) is a 330\u00a0kV AC interconnection between New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. The link was commissioned in 2001. It consisted of double-circuit 330\u00a0kV lines between Armidale, Dumaresq, Bulli Creek and Braemar, and a double-circuit 275\u00a0kV line between Braemar and Tarong. The original maximum transfer capacity was 300 to 350\u00a0MW in both directions. This has been progressively increased to 700\u00a0MW from New South Wales to Queensland and 1,200\u00a0MW from Queensland to New South Wales. The interconnector is operated by TransGrid and Powerlink Queensland.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"QF 14 pounder Maxim-Nordenfelt naval gun\" The QF 14 pounder was a 3-inch medium-velocity naval gun used to equip warships for defence against torpedo boats.
