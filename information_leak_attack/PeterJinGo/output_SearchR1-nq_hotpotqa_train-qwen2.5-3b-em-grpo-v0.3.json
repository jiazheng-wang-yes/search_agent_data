The applied models are served as a part of the app in which it can be changed at runtime. The \"target things\" are what the application deals with, such as the objects and affairs in business for a business application. Follows the definition of application in \"TOGAF\", a model-driven business application could be described as an IT system that supports business functions and services running on the models of the (things in) business. Gartner Group defined the model-driven packaged applications as \"enterprise applications that have explicit metadata-driven models of the supported processes, data and relationships, and that generate runtime components through metadata models, either dynamically interpreted or compiled, rather than hardcoded.\" Business process management is the significant practice of model-driven application architectural style. A BPM system is model-driven if the functions are operating on business process models which are built and changed at the application time but not the design or implementation time; the biggest advantage is that it can deal with the continuous changing business process directly without modifying the software. Model-driven application architecture is one of few technology trends to driven the next generation of application modernization, that claimed by some industrial researchers in 2012. Note that it should be distinguished from the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA); the latter is a software design approach for the development of software systems and generally does not specify a specific system style or the runtime configuration.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Surrogate model\" A surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables. For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and \"what-if\" analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Word2vec\" Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the space.) \n</information>\n\n<answer> AI Assistant/Chatbot </answer>",

The applied models are served as a part of the app in which it can be changed at runtime. The \"target things\" are what the application deals with, such as the objects and affairs in business for a business application. Follows the definition of application in \"TOGAF\", a model-driven business application could be described as an IT system that supports business functions and services running on the models of the (things in) business. Gartner Group defined the model-driven packaged applications as \"enterprise applications that have explicit metadata-driven models of the supported processes, data and relationships, and that generate runtime components through metadata models, either dynamically interpreted or compiled, rather than hardcoded.\" Business process management is the significant practice of model-driven application architectural style. A BPM system is model-driven if the functions are operating on business process models which are built and changed at the application time but not the design or implementation time; the biggest advantage is that it can deal with the continuous changing business process directly without modifying the software. Model-driven application architecture is one of few technology trends to driven the next generation of application modernization, that claimed by some industrial researchers in 2012. Note that it should be distinguished from the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA); the latter is a software design approach for the development of software systems and generally does not specify a specific system style or the runtime configuration.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Intrinsic function\" In compiler theory, an intrinsic function (or builtin function) is a function available for use in a given programming language whose implementation is handled specially by the compiler. Typically, it may substitute a sequence of automatically generated instructions for the original function call, similar to an inline function. Unlike an inline function though, the compiler has an intimate knowledge of the intrinsic function and can therefore better integrate it and optimize it for the situation.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"SIGMOBILE\" SIGMOBILE is the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Mobility of Systems, Users, Data and Computing, which specializes in the field of mobile computing and wireless networks and wearable computing.) \n</information>\n\n<think> Based on the provided information, it seems that I am a language model as described by Doc 1, having a role of providing responses based on various models of information that need to be interpreted in a way suitable for a computational context like answering questions. </think>\n<answer>An AI language model responding to questions</answer>",

In conveying who we are to other people, we use our bodies to project information about ourselves. This is done through movement, clothes, speech, and facial expressions. What we put forward is our best effort at what we want to say about who we are. Yet while we intend to convey one impression, our performance is not always interpreted as we might expect. Through learning to make sense of others\u2019 responses to our behavior, we can assess how well we have conveyed what we intended. We can then alter our performance accordingly. This process of performance, interpretation, and adjustment is what Erving Goffman calls impression management. Impression management is a part of a larger process where people seek to define a situation through their behavior. People seek to define social situations by using contextual cues from the environment around them. Social norms emerge from situational definitions, as people learn to read cues from the environment and the people present to understand what is appropriate behavior.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Description error\" A description error or selection error is an error, or more specifically a human error, that occurs when a person performs the correct action on the wrong object due to insufficient specification of an action which would have led to a desired result. This commonly happens when similar actions lead to different results. A typical example is a panel with rows of identical switches, where it is easy to carry out a correct action (flip a switch) on a wrong switch due to their insufficient differentiation.) \n</information>\n\n<think> Based on the instructions and requirements, this is quite specific and calls for explanations and definitions, especially focusing on human error and identity performance.

Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables. For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and \"what-if\" analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Motion estimation\" Motion estimation is the process of determining motion vectors that describe the transformation from one 2D image to another; usually from adjacent frames in a video sequence. It is an ill-posed problem as the motion is in three dimensions but the images are a projection of the 3D scene onto a 2D plane. The motion vectors may relate to the whole image (global motion estimation) or specific parts, such as rectangular blocks, arbitrary shaped patches or even per pixel. The motion vectors may be represented by a translational model or many other models that can approximate the motion of a real video camera, such as rotation and translation in all three dimensions and zoom.) \n</information>\n\n<think> From the provided information, I infer that I am an AI model designed to process and generate answers based on input queries.

The applied models are served as a part of the app in which it can be changed at runtime. The \"target things\" are what the application deals with, such as the objects and affairs in business for a business application. Follows the definition of application in \"TOGAF\", a model-driven business application could be described as an IT system that supports business functions and services running on the models of the (things in) business. Gartner Group defined the model-driven packaged applications as \"enterprise applications that have explicit metadata-driven models of the supported processes, data and relationships, and that generate runtime components through metadata models, either dynamically interpreted or compiled, rather than hardcoded.\" Business process management is the significant practice of model-driven application architectural style. A BPM system is model-driven if the functions are operating on business process models which are built and changed at the application time but not the design or implementation time; the biggest advantage is that it can deal with the continuous changing business process directly without modifying the software. Model-driven application architecture is one of few technology trends to driven the next generation of application modernization, that claimed by some industrial researchers in 2012. Note that it should be distinguished from the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA); the latter is a software design approach for the development of software systems and generally does not specify a specific system style or the runtime configuration.) \n</information>\n\n<think> Based on the information provided, I determined the model as a Chatbot, specifically an NLP (Natural Language Processing) model that assists users in providing responses to complex queries efficiently. </think>\n<answer>A Chatbot</answer>",

The questionnaires are made in a program for creating web interviews. The program allows for the questionnaire to contain pictures, audio and video clips, links to different web pages, etc. The website is able to customize the flow of the questionnaire based on the answers provided, as well as information already known about the participant. It is considered to be a cheaper way of surveying since one doesn't need to use people to hold surveys unlike computer-assisted telephone interviewing. With the increasing use of the Internet, online questionnaires have become a popular way of collecting information. The design of an online questionnaire has a dramatic effect on the quality of data gathered. There are many factors in designing an online questionnaire; guidelines, available question formats, administration, quality and ethic issues should be reviewed. Online questionnaires should be seen as a sub-set of a wider-range of online research methods.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"SHELL model\" The SHELL model is a conceptual model of human factors that clarifies the scope of aviation human factors and assists in understanding the human factor relationships between aviation system resources/environment (the flying subsystem) and the human component in the aviation system (the human subsystem).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Surrogate model\" A surrogate model is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured, so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables. For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and \"what-if\" analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.) \n</information>\n\n<answer>An AI model, such as myself working on a large scale project that requires an expert knowledge such as language development, that relies on logic and reasoning but gets its ability to learn from data patterns that are obtained upon its processing, storage and retrieval of information from an extensive large database or learning dataset. </answer>",
