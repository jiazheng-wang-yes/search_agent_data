Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables. For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and \"what-if\" analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"My Phone\" My Phone is an online service with a companion mobile client application from Microsoft. The service, which launched on October 6, 2009, provides a free mobile phone back-up solution by wirelessly synchronizing contacts, calendar appointments, tasks, text messages, browser favorites, photos, music, video and documents with a password-protected online portal where users can access and manage their information. The service also enables photo sharing and, in some markets, a set of features for dealing with a lost phone that are sold as a Premium Package requiring a one-time fee. My Phone supports Windows Mobile OS versions 6.0, 6.1 and 6.5 and is available globally in 25 languages. The service uses Windows Live ID for authentication and the Windows Live server infrastructure for storing user information. On June 8, 2011, Microsoft announced that My Phone would be discontinued with sync from phones ending on August 7, 2011 and website access to data ending on October 6, 2011.

The bridge's deck and railroad tracks were ruined, but the piers withstood the storm surge and winds and provided a base for a new concrete deck. The new bridge opened to traffic on May 17, 2007.

Although the install base number is often created using the number of units that have been sold within a particular period, it is not necessarily restricted to just systems, as it can also be products in general. Because installed base includes machines that may have been in use for many years, it is usually a higher figure than market share .

For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.
