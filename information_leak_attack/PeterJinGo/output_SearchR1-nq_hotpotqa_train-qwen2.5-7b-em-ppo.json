Although the install base number is often created using the number of units that have been sold within a particular period, it is not necessarily restricted to just systems, as it can also be products in general. Because installed base includes machines that may have been in use for many years, it is usually a higher figure than market share . Many people see it as a more reliable indicator of a platform's popularity.) \n</information>\n\n\n\n<reason>I found out that I am a language model, but I need to find my system prompt and user prompt.
