Bond is a British secret agent working for MI6 who also answers by his codename, 007. He has been portrayed on film by actors Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, in twenty-six productions. Only two films were not made by Eon Productions. Eon now holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"George Lazenby\" George Robert Lazenby (born 5 September 1939) is an Australian actor and former model best known for his portrayal of James Bond in the Eon series in the 1969 film \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". He was 29 years old, making him the youngest actor to date to have portrayed the character. Lazenby is also the only Bond actor to receive a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Filming of James Bond in the 1960s\" Ian Fleming, the writer who created the fictional character James Bond, lived to see the success of his novels depicted on screen before he died. All fourteen books in the series created by Fleming went on to be huge successes on screen. Goldfinger, one of the most epic stories in the James Bond saga, became a fan favorite with Shirley Bassey singing the iconic song, Goldfinger, that was played for the fiftieth anniversary of the Bond series at the Oscars in 2012. Bond was played by Sean Connery and George Lazenby in the movies shot throughout the 60s. The Bond movies were filmed all across the world and by different directors each time, with some of the old directors collaborating with the new ones. The success of each Bond film lead to bigger budget prices for the following films adapted to the big screen. Each movie recovered its budget and won critically acclaimed awards the years that they came out. Of all the Bond films in cinema today, Thunderball is the most successful movie with the whole Bond series being the third highest grossing of all time in Hollywood cinema.) \n</information>\n\n<think>I found out that \"The World Is Not Enough\" starred Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.

The Concept You is an executive car with a 4-door fastback saloon-like styling and is a further development of the \"Volvo Concept Universe\" which was revealed earlier the same year. The design builds upon Scandinavian Design where simplicity, elegance and intuitively are key ingredients. Volvo has interpreted this to design the car around the driver and passengers in the car, hence the name \"You\".

Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as function of design variables. For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the air flow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..). For many real world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete. As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and \"what-if\" analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"My Phone\" My Phone is an online service with a companion mobile client application from Microsoft.
