Question: Bridgewater Trustees major source of income came from a canal that was commissioned by whom/?\n<think>\nThe question asks about the Bridgewater Trustees' major source of income, specifically from a canal, and who commissioned that canal. The Bridgewater Trustees are known historically for managing the Bridgewater Canal, which was a significant early canal in England instrumental in the transport of coal.\n\nI need to identify who commissioned the Bridgewater Canal, which would have been the source of income for the Bridgewater Trustees.

James Brindley was the engineer who played a vital role in constructing the canal but was not the commissioner or financier.\n\nSince the documents do not provide direct answers but rather questions highlighting these aspects, I will refine the search specifically for the commissioner of the Bridgewater Canal with emphasis on the Duke of Bridgewater.\n\nI will search: \"Francis Egerton Duke of Bridgewater commission Bridgewater Canal\".\n</think>\n\n<search> Francis Egerton Duke of Bridgewater commission Bridgewater Canal </search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Robert Haldane Bradshaw\" Robert Haldane Bradshaw (1759\u20131835) was an English politician and agent to Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater and, after the Duke's death, was the first Superintendent of the Bridgewater Trustees. The Trustees administered the Duke's estate, which included coal mines at Worsley and the Bridgewater Canal.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Bridgewater Collieries\" Bridgewater Collieries originated from the coal mines on the Manchester Coalfield in Worsley in the historic county of Lancashire owned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater in the second half of the 18th century.

The Trustees then managed the source of income (the canal) after his death.\n\nThus, the major source of income for the Bridgewater Trustees came from a canal commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater.\n\nNo further search appears necessary now.\n</think>\n\n<answer> The Bridgewater Canal, which was the major source of income for the Bridgewater Trustees, was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. </answer>",

He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi.

Irrespective of the roles, he left an indelible impression on the viewers and the critics. He also acted in the leading role in a tele-serial named \"Naqab\" in the national network of Doordarshan. He is one of the very few selected actors who worked with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen; with the first three directors, he performed in more than a number of occasion.

His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Debashree Roy filmography\" Debashree Roy is an Indian actress who has performed in over hundred films.

The war was fought between the government of Sierra Leone, supported by the majority of ethnic groups including the Mende, against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which was infamous for brutalities.\n\nThe conflict severely affected the Mende community in eastern and southern Sierra Leone, where the Mende are predominantly located.

All of the other counties were apportioned from these two original counties. Florida became the 27th U.S. state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County. Florida's counties are subdivisions of the state government. In 1968, counties gained the power to develop their own charters. All but two of Florida's county seats are incorporated municipalities.

Since the decathlon is a combined event in track and field consisting of ten events, I should clarify what the decathlon is commonly referred to.

Are there health risks or care considerations associated with moleras in dogs?</information>\n\n<think>The new information confirms that a molera is a \"hole\" or fontanelle in the skull of Chihuahuas, at the junction of the parietal and frontal bones. It further says that moleras vary in size and shape, implying there might be different forms. Since the question is about the molera coming in two something, it is most likely \"two forms\" or \"two types.\" Given that the molera varies in size and shape, the two forms are likely related to these differences. \n\nI should do one more refined search specifically on \"molera two forms\" or \"molera two types\" in the context of Chihuahuas to confirm the exact terminology used for the two forms or types the molera comes in.</think>\n\n<search>molera Chihuahua two forms types explanation</search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Molera\" A molera is a \"hole\" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies. Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \"hole in the head\". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.

The most common interpretation in veterinary or breed standards is that fontanelles can come in two main forms: persistent/open or closed or large and small. Alternatively, it could be that the Chihuahua breed comes in two varieties (e.g., apple head and deer head) and that molera appears in both.\n\nTo be certain, I will search for \"Chihuahua molera comes in two forms\" or \"molera two forms\" directly to find a precise explanation.\n\nI will do one last focused search with the query:\n\n\"molera comes in two forms\" Chihuahua</think>\n\n<search>molera comes in two forms Chihuahua</search>\n\n<information>Doc 1(Title: \"Molera\" A molera is a \"hole\" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies.
