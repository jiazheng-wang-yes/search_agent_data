To answer this, I need to identify the canal associated with Bridgewater Trustees and determine who commissioned it. Bridgewater Trustees are historically linked to the Bridgewater Canal, which is a famous canal in England. The canal was commissioned by Francis Egerton, the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, in the late 18th century. This canal was instrumental in transporting coal and became a major source of income for the trustees overseeing it.

He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi. He played different shades, though mostly as a character actor, as well as in leading roles and at times as an antagonist, despite the limited opportunities he received.

He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\" Aaj Ka Robin Hood (Translation: Today's robin hood) is a 1988 adventure-drama Indian Hindi film directed and produced by Tapan Sinha.

Cinderella stories tend to gain much media and fan attention as they move closer to the championship game at the end of the tournament. The term comes from \"Cinderella\", a well-known European folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression/triumphant reward. The title character is a woman living in unfortunate circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune. In a sporting context the term has been used at least since 1939, but came into widespread usage in 1950, when the Disney movie came out that year, and in reference to City College of New York, the unexpected winners of the NCAA Men's Basketball championship also that year.

The 2013 film is likely \"Ip Man 3,\" which was released in 2015. Wait, that doesn\u2019t align with the year. Let me verify.\n\nActually, \"Ip Man 3\" was released in 2015. So perhaps the 2013 film is \"Ip Man 2\" \u2014 but that was 2010. Wait, there is a 2013 film titled \"The Grandmaster,\" directed by Wong Kar-wai, which is a biographical martial arts film about Ip Man. That fits the description: 2013, Hong Kong-Chinese, martial arts, based on Ip Man\u2019s life. So the film in question is likely \"The Grandmaster.\"\n\nNow, I need to identify the sound editor for \"The Grandmaster\" (2013). Then, determine which film this sound editor won two Academy Awards for.

Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \"hole in the head\". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.

After multiple searches, it appears that the information is not available in the provided results. However, based on general knowledge, a molera in dogs typically comes in two forms: a small, soft spot (which is normal and often seen in Chihuahuas) and a larger, more prominent one. These variations are related to size and shape, which are commonly described as the two forms.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>size and shape</answer>"
