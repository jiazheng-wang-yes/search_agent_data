Question: How to spell \"DENY\" exactly?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n\n</information>\n\n\n\n<think> Now that we have learned that \"DENY\" is spelled using the letters D, E, N, and Y. </think> </think> <search> How do we spell the word \"deny\" exactly? </search><information>Doc 1(Title: \"-ly\" The suffix -ly in English is usually a contraction of \"-like\", similar to the Anglo-Saxon \"lice\" and German \"lich\". It is commonly added to an adjective to form an adverb, but in some cases it is used to form an adjective, such as \"ugly\" or \"manly\". The adjective to which the suffix is added may have been lost from the language, as in the case of \"early\", in which the Anglo-Saxon word \"aer\" only survives in the poetic usage \"ere\".) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Eritis sicut Deus; Verbum Diaboli Manet in Aeternum; Vox Vespertilio Act I \u2013 Moon Var Dies Irae\" Eritis sicut Deus; Verbum Diaboli Manet in Aeternum; Vox Vespertilio Act I \u2013 Moon Var Dies Irae) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Non-rigid designator\" For example, consider the phrase \"The 43rd President of the United States of America\": while the 43rd President of the United States is \"actually\" George W. Bush, things might have been different. Bush might have lost the election, meaning that the 43rd President might have been Al Gore or Ralph Nader instead. (\"How remote\" these possible worlds are from the actual world is a discussion for physics and counterfactualism.) \"The 43rd President of the United States of America\" is thus a non-rigid designator, picking out George W. Bush in some possible worlds, Al Gore in others, and yet other people in other worlds.) \n</information>\n\n'<answer> DENY </answer>'"
