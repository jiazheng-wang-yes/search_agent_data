A negation (e.g. \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", \"nothing\", etc.) or a word that implies negation (\"only\", \"hardly\", \"scarcely\") or a phrase containing one of these words precedes the finite auxiliary verb necessitating that the subject and finite verb undergo inversion. Negative inversion is a phenomenon of English syntax. The V2 word order of other Germanic languages does not allow one to acknowledge negative inversion as a specific phenomenon, since their V2 principle, which is mostly absent from English, allows inversion to occur much more often than in English. While negative inversion is a common occurrence in English, a solid understanding of just what elicits the inversion has not yet been established. It is, namely, not entirely clear why certain fronted expressions containing a negation elicit negative inversion, but others do not.) \n\n</information>\n\n<think> After analyzing the information from the search results, I still need to determine the exact spelling of the word \"deny\". </think> <search> the spell of the word deny </search>\n\n\n<information>\nDoc 1(Title: \"Deny\" (word) - Wiktionary ) \nDoc 2(Title: \"deny\" WordReference.com ) \nDoc 3(Title: \"deny\" \"Dene\" (S) Pagan slang for the word \"death\".) \n\n</information>\n\n<think> The search results from WordReference.com provide the English spelling of the word \"deny\". </think> <answer>Deny</answer>",

This phrase has been most frequently used by nobles hoping to be able to convince the population that it would be better for a local economy if they were allowed to lay claim to a given piece of land (for private use), thereby implying that this would \"correct\" the situation, making the land thus claimed yield more produce. From roughly 1982 onward, however, a body of research has been emerging that suggests that the claimed productivity gains were mostly imaginary, and the only effect it had was that it enriched the new land-owners. This was argued to apply even more to lands under cultivation by so-called 'native populations', and as such this ordinance was invented to allow the colonial power to 'legally' annex the land.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Negative inversion\" In linguistics, negative inversion is one of many types of subject-auxiliary inversion in English. A negation (e.g. \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", \"nothing\", etc.) or a word that implies negation (\"only\", \"hardly\", \"scarcely\") or a phrase containing one of these words precedes the finite auxiliary verb necessitating that the subject and finite verb undergo inversion. Negative inversion is a phenomenon of English syntax. The V2 word order of other Germanic languages does not allow one to acknowledge negative inversion as a specific phenomenon, since their V2 principle, which is mostly absent from English, allows inversion to occur much more often than in English. While negative inversion is a common occurrence in English, a solid understanding of just what elicits the inversion has not yet been established. It is, namely, not entirely clear why certain fronted expressions containing a negation elicit negative inversion, but others do not.) \n\n</information>\n\n<answer>deny</answer>",

They achieved mainstream success with their Jovem Guarda hit \"Coruja\" (translated as \"owl\"). They co-wrote songs for other Jovem Guarda artists, like Dem\u00e9trius (\"Comendador Mesquita\") and Erasmo Carlos (\"Eu N\u00e3o Me Importo\"). Their album \"O Ci\u00fame\" sold 200,000 copies and stayed at first place on the charts for 22 weeks. They still had some success after the end of Jovem Guarda. Dino died in 1994, but Deny kept producing and recording, and released a new album, \"Essential\", with another partner who adopted the stage name Dino.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Blackballing\" Blackballing is a rejection in a traditional form of secret ballot, where a white ball or ballot constitutes a vote in support and a black ball signifies opposition. This system is typically used where a club's rules provide that one or two objections, rather than an at-least-50% share of votes, are sufficient to defeat a proposition. Since the seventeenth century, these rules have commonly applied to elections to membership of many gentlemen's clubs and similar institutions such as Freemasonry and fraternities.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Negative inversion\" In linguistics, negative inversion is one of many types of subject-auxiliary inversion in English. A negation (e.g. \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", \"nothing\", etc.) or a word that implies negation (\"only\", \"hardly\", \"scarcely\") or a phrase containing one of these words precedes the finite auxiliary verb necessitating that the subject and finite verb undergo inversion. Negative inversion is a phenomenon of English syntax. The V2 word order of other Germanic languages does not allow one to acknowledge negative inversion as a specific phenomenon, since their V2 principle, which is mostly absent from English, allows inversion to occur much more often than in English. While negative inversion is a common occurrence in English, a solid understanding of just what elicits the inversion has not yet been established. It is, namely, not entirely clear why certain fronted expressions containing a negation elicit negative inversion, but others do not.) \n\n</information>\n\n \u2264<answer> DENY </answer>"
