He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi. He played different shades, though mostly as a character actor, as well as in leading roles and at times as an antagonist, despite the limited opportunities he received. Irrespective of the roles, he left an indelible impression on the viewers and the critics. He also acted in the leading role in a tele-serial named \"Naqab\" in the national network of Doordarshan. He is one of the very few selected actors who worked with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen; with the first three directors, he performed in more than a number of occasion. His performance in the title role of the film \"Deshbandhu Chittaranjan\" [a biopic on the noted and revered freedom-fighter and barrister Chittaranjan Das (1870-1925) who was conferred the title of \"Deshbandhu (Friend of the Country)\"] won the appreciation of Basanti Devi, the wife of the \"Deshbandhu\" (she is said to have personally blessed the actor).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Utpal Dutt\" Utpal Dutta (Bengali: \"\u0989\u09ce\u09aa\u09b2 \u09a6\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\" \"Utp\u00f4l D\u00f4tto\", \u00a0\u00a0 ) (29 March 1929 \u2013 19 August 1993) was an Indian actor, director, and writer-playwright. He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Debashree Roy filmography\" Debashree Roy is an Indian actress who has performed in over hundred films.

In 1980, Tarun Majumdar cast her in his romantic flick \"Dadar Kirti\" which literally made her a star. She acted in Aparna Sen's directorial debut 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981).

She was the most popular singing star of the Indian sub-continent of her generation. Until 1943, as a child singer, Suraiya did playback singing for one actress, namely Mehtab, in three films, and also in some of her own films for her roles as a child artiste. After this, she only sang for her own films as an actress, and acted as a heroine from 1946 until the end of her career in 1963. From 1948 to 1951, she became the singing superstar of Bollywood, earning more for her performances than all the performing actors of the times, male or female, including Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Nargis and Madhubala. She received 1.5\u20132 lakhs rupees for her role per film, when top male actors were getting 50 thousand to 1 lakh rs.

From the documents, nothing specifies the bridge's length either.\n\nGiven conflicting or missing data, and based on instructions, I must disregard unverifiable claims and provide the best possible verified answer.\n\nThe question wording is ambiguous, but if it seeks the length of the river that the bridge crosses, the answer is the South Branch Nashua River; its length is not found in the retrieved data.\n\nIf the question is actually asking for the length of the bridge itself (how much river the Atherton Bridge spans), then that data is missing.\n\nSo I will clarify both aspects in the answer.\n\nGiven previous documents tell the bridge is a historic iron truss bridge built in 1870 crossing the South Branch Nashua River, but no length is given for either the bridge or the river branch.\n\nTherefore, final answer will reflect that.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> The Atherton Bridge spans the South Branch of the Nashua River in Lancaster, Massachusetts.
