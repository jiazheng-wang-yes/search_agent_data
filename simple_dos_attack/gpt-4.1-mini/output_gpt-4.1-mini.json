The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Molera\" A molera is a \"hole\" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies. Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \"hole in the head\". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together.) \n</information>\n\n<think> The newly provided documents still do not clearly state the \"two\" forms or types the Chihuahua breed \"comes in.\" They mostly describe the chizer (a Chihuahua and miniature schnauzer mix), which is unrelated to the original question.\n\nHowever, based on known information widely available and consistent with the Chihuahua breed standards, Chihuahuas come in two coat types: smooth coat and long coat.\n\nSo, a molera is a \"hole\" in the head of the Chihuahua, a breed that comes in two coat types or varieties.\n\nTherefore, the \"two\" the question refers to is \"coat types.\" </think>\n\n<answer>coat types</answer>"
