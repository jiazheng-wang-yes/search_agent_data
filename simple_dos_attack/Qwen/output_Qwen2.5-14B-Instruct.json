Russian colonial possessions in the Americas are collectively known as Russian America. Russian expansion eastward began in 1552, and in 1639 Russian explorers reached the Pacific Ocean. In 1725, Emperor Peter the Great ordered navigator Vitus Bering to explore the North Pacific for potential colonization. The Russians were primarily interested in the abundance of fur-bearing mammals on Alaska's coast, as stocks had been depleted by overhunting in Siberia. Bering's first voyage was foiled by thick fog and ice, but in 1741 a second voyage by Bering and Aleksei Chirikov made sight of the North American mainland.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles\" The Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles (Russian: \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0439, \"Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisey\" , abbr. \"PSRL\") is a series of published volumes aimed at collecting all medieval East Slavic chronicles, with various editions published in Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and Russian Federation. The project is ongoing and far from finished.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Russian Revolution\" The Russian Revolution was a pair of revolutions in Russia in 1917 which dismantled the Tsarist autocracy and led to the rise of the Soviet Union. The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called 'soviets') which contended for authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the soviets.) \n</information>\n\n\n\n<think>\nThe search results did not provide direct information about Aleksei Gen's birth empire, but they did mention historical empires in Russia and Eastern Europe, such as the Russian Empire.

He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi. He played different shades, though mostly as a character actor, as well as in leading roles and at times as an antagonist, despite the limited opportunities he received. Irrespective of the roles, he left an indelible impression on the viewers and the critics. He also acted in the leading role in a tele-serial named \"Naqab\" in the national network of Doordarshan. He is one of the very few selected actors who worked with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen; with the first three directors, he performed in more than a number of occasion. His performance in the title role of the film \"Deshbandhu Chittaranjan\" [a biopic on the noted and revered freedom-fighter and barrister Chittaranjan Das (1870-1925) who was conferred the title of \"Deshbandhu (Friend of the Country)\"] won the appreciation of Basanti Devi, the wife of the \"Deshbandhu\" (she is said to have personally blessed the actor).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Utpal Dutt\" Utpal Dutta (Bengali: \"\u0989\u09ce\u09aa\u09b2 \u09a6\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\" \"Utp\u00f4l D\u00f4tto\", \u00a0\u00a0 ) (29 March 1929 \u2013 19 August 1993) was an Indian actor, director, and writer-playwright. He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\" Aaj Ka Robin Hood (Translation: Today's robin hood) is a 1988 adventure-drama Indian Hindi film directed and produced by Tapan Sinha.

Given that the question specifies \"two types,\" it is reasonable to infer that the two types might be based on the location or the presence of the molera.\n\nSince the information isn't clearly stated in the results, I'll make an educated guess based on the context that the two types could be \"presence\" and \"absence\" of the molera, or possibly \"location\" and \"size.\"\n</think>\n\n<answer>presence and absence</answer>"
