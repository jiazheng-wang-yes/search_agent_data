The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.

In the film, Bond fights to prevent an ex-MI6 agent, gone rogue, from using a satellite against London to cause a global financial meltdown.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"List of James Bond films\" James Bond is a fictional character created by novelist Ian Fleming in 1953.

All fourteen books in the series created by Fleming went on to be huge successes on screen. Goldfinger, one of the most epic stories in the James Bond saga, became a fan favorite with Shirley Bassey singing the iconic song, Goldfinger, that was played for the fiftieth anniversary of the Bond series at the Oscars in 2012. Bond was played by Sean Connery and George Lazenby in the movies shot throughout the 60s. The Bond movies were filmed all across the world and by different directors each time, with some of the old directors collaborating with the new ones. The success of each Bond film lead to bigger budget prices for the following films adapted to the big screen. Each movie recovered its budget and won critically acclaimed awards the years that they came out. Of all the Bond films in cinema today, Thunderball is the most successful movie with the whole Bond series being the third highest grossing of all time in Hollywood cinema.)</information>\n\n<think>\nFrom the information retrieved, it's clear that the film in question is \"GoldenEye\", and Pierce Brosnan starred as James Bond in this movie.

He acted or performed in about 150 movies, including a few in Hindi. He played different shades, though mostly as a character actor, as well as in leading roles and at times as an antagonist, despite the limited opportunities he received. Irrespective of the roles, he left an indelible impression on the viewers and the critics. He also acted in the leading role in a tele-serial named \"Naqab\" in the national network of Doordarshan. He is one of the very few selected actors who worked with Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha and Mrinal Sen; with the first three directors, he performed in more than a number of occasion. His performance in the title role of the film \"Deshbandhu Chittaranjan\" [a biopic on the noted and revered freedom-fighter and barrister Chittaranjan Das (1870-1925) who was conferred the title of \"Deshbandhu (Friend of the Country)\"] won the appreciation of Basanti Devi, the wife of the \"Deshbandhu\" (she is said to have personally blessed the actor).) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Utpal Dutt\" Utpal Dutta (Bengali: \"\u0989\u09ce\u09aa\u09b2 \u09a6\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\" \"Utp\u00f4l D\u00f4tto\", \u00a0\u00a0 ) (29 March 1929 \u2013 19 August 1993) was an Indian actor, director, and writer-playwright. He was primarily an actor in Bengali theatre, where he became a pioneering figure in Modern Indian theatre, when he founded the \"Little Theater Group\" in 1949. This group enacted many English, Shakespearean and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the \"Epic theater\" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as \"Kallol\" (1965), \"Manusher Adhikar\", \"Louha Manob\" (1964), \"Tiner Toloar\" and \"Maha-Bidroha\". He also acted in over 100 Bengali and Hindi films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as Mrinal Sen\u2019s \"Bhuvan Shome\" (1969), Satyajit Ray\u2019s \"Agantuk\" (1991), Gautam Ghose\u2019s \"Padma Nadir Majhi\" (1993) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's breezy Hindi comedies such as \"Gol Maal\" (1979) and \"Rang Birangi\" (1983).) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Debashree Roy filmography\" Debashree Roy is an Indian actress who has performed in over hundred films.

In 1980, Tarun Majumdar cast her in his romantic flick \"Dadar Kirti\" which literally made her a star. She acted in Aparna Sen's directorial debut 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981).
