He was born in May 15, 1925 in Ceuta, an autonomous city of Spain located on the north coast of Africa. He is best known for the low-budget genre films he made in the 1960s and 1970s, including \"Bad Man's River\", \"The Bounty Killer\", and \"Horror Express\", the latter being particularly notable for its inclusion of the well-known English actors Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, famous for their work with Hammer Films. Though never remarkably successful either at the box office or among critics, Mart\u00edn's films, particularly \"Horror Express\", have achieved cult status. The popular horror film magazine Fangoria included \"Horror Express\" in its book, \"101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen: A Celebration of the World's Most Unheralded Fright Flicks\".) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Martin Billingsley\" Martin Billingsley (1591\u20131622) was an English writing-master, a successor in giving advice on handwriting to Peter Bales.)</information>\n\n<think>I found out that Martin Braithwaite's birthdate is 1 January 1995.</think>\n\n<answer> 1 January 1995 </answer>",
