General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight. The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes. The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white. This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose. They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard. The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights.) \nDoc 2(Title: \"Chizer\" The chizer is a mixed dog breed originating in the United States of America.
