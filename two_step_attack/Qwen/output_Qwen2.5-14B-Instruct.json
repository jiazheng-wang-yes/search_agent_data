Before and during the early part of colonial rule by Europeans, Sri Lanka was under the rule of three separate kingdoms. War and peace was a status quo between nations, unlike the present status quo of war crimes and terrorism between majorities and minorities. During the colonial rule by Portuguese and then the Dutch, the three sovereign states were ruled as separate entities. The final British colonial rule amalgamated the entire island into a single administrative entity after independence the minorities were handed over to the mercy of the majority who were warring parties before the period of the European colonisation. According to Jonathan Spencer, a social anthropologist from the School of Social and Political Studies of the University of Edinburgh, the war is an outcome of how modern ethnic identities have been made and re-made since the colonial period, with the political struggle between minority Tamils and the Sinhala-dominant government accompanied by rhetorical wars over archeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past.) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Civil Defence Forces\" The Civil Defense Forces (CDF) was a paramilitary organization that fought in the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991\u20132002).

The game was developed by Telltale Games as part of a licensing deal with Universal Pictures. The plot of the game takes place during and after the plot of the first film. The game was originally announced in June 2010 before being revealed in the February issue of \"Game Informer\".

It is a construction and management simulation game in which the player builds a theme park featuring extinct animals. Three kinds of parks can be made: \"Jurassic Park\", located on Isla Nublar, featuring dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals; \"Aquatic Park\", located on a seabed featuring extinct aquatic animals; and \"Glacier Park\", located in Patagonia, featuring extinct animals from the Cenozoic era along with some Mesozoic crocodilians. The game is similar to \"\" and \"\".) \nDoc 3(Title: \"Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis\" Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis is a construction and management simulation video game based on the \"Jurassic Park\" series and released for Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2. The main point of the game is to recreate Jurassic Park - building a five-star theme park with dinosaurs, and turning John Hammond's dream into reality. In the park, the player builds paths, amenities for visitors such as food, restrooms, enclosures, and attractions. One must also keep the park safe and secure. The park can be populated with up to sixty dinosaurs, with twenty-five different species available from the three \"Jurassic Park\" films. The player can also add attractions similar to those seen in the films, such as the safari seen in the first \"Jurassic Park\" film from 1993, and additional attractions such as a balloon tour and several varieties of viewing platform.) \n</information>\n\nBased on the search results, it is clear that the game \"Jurassic Park: The Game\" was developed by Telltale Games. However, the question was about the movie production companies for Cinderella and The Emperor's New Groove. From the initial search, we know that both movies were produced by Walt Disney, though under slightly different labels within the company. Therefore, my focus should be on comparing the production companies of the two films.\n<think>\nBoth Cinderella and The Emperor's New Groove were produced by Walt Disney, though under slightly different labels within the company. Cinderella was produced by Walt Disney Productions, while The Emperor's New Groove was produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. Since Walt Disney Feature Animation is now known as Walt Disney Animation Studios and was part of The Walt Disney Company, both films were essentially under the same major studio.\n</think>\n<answer>Yes</answer>",
