No specific actor born in 1951 is mentioned.\nDoc 2(Title: \"Anil Chatterjee\") Anil Chatterjee is an Indian film actor born in 1947. He has appeared in several Hindi films including \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\".\nDoc 3(Title: \"Utpal Dutt\") Utpal Dutt was an Indian film actor and director born in 1929. He starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\".\nDoc 4(Title: \"Satish Shah\") Satish Shah is an Indian film actor born in 1946. He starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\".\nDoc 5(Title: \"Nana Patekar\") Nana Patekar is an Indian film actor and producer born in 1956. He starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\".\nDoc 6(Title: \"Rabi Ghosh\") Rabi Ghosh is an Indian film actor born in 1950. He starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\".\n</information>\n\n<think>\nBased on the information provided, none of the actors listed were born in 1951 and starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\". However, Rabi Ghosh, who starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\", was born in 1950, which is very close to 1951. Since the exact match isn't found, we need to verify if there's any actor born in 1951 associated with the film. Otherwise, we can conclude that the question might be based on incorrect assumptions or lack precise information.\n</think>\n<search>actors born in 1951 in Indian cinema</search><information>Doc 1(Title: \"Actors Born in 1951\") List of actors born in 1951 includes Shashi Kapoor, but there is no mention of any actor born in 1951 who starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\".\nDoc 2(Title: \"Shashi Kapoor\") Shashi Kapoor is an Indian film actor and producer born in 1938. He passed away in 2020. No mention of him starring in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\".\nDoc 3(Title: \"Other Actors Born in 1951\") There are no other significant actors born in 1951 who have notable roles in Indian cinema.\n</information>\n\n<think>\nAfter searching for actors born in 1951, there doesn't seem to be any prominent actor from that year who starred in \"Aaj Ka Robin Hood\". The most likely candidate would be Rabi Ghosh, born in 1950, but he doesn't fit the exact birth year requirement. Given the information available, it appears there may be a mistake in the original question regarding the actor's birth year.\n</think>\n<answer>Rabi Ghosh</answer>",

I need to reformulate my search to focus on the specific breed known for having a molera and what it comes in two of.

It seems the question is asking about a specific characteristic related to the size or shape of the molera in a particular dog breed. I need to find out which breed this pertains to and what the two characteristics of the molera in this breed are.\n<search>dog breed with a molera that comes in two sizes</search><information>Doc 1(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.

I will refine my search query to focus more precisely on the breed known for having a molera and the specific traits related to it.\n<search>breed of dog known for having a molera that comes in two sizes</search><information>Doc 1(Title: \"A molera is a \"hole\" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?\") \nA molera is a \"hole\" in the skull of a dog breed and it comes in two forms?\n1.

Let's try specifying the breed name, as it seems to be the Xoloitzcuintli (Xolo), which is known for having a molera.
